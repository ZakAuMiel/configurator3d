# configurator3d

This proof of concept showcases a lightweight and interactive 3D product configurator designed for the Schmidt Group. Built using React and Babylon.js v3, the demo allows users to select different furniture models, switch between textures and colors, and trigger animations (such as opening doors or rotating objects) to demonstrate product interactivity.

The main goals of the POC are to:

    Prove technical feasibility of a modern web-based 3D configurator.

    Demonstrate the ability to load and interact with realistic 3D assets.

    Provide a smooth and visually appealing experience suitable for integration into an e-commerce or in-store tablet interface.

The setup is optimized for performance and structured to be scalable, with potential future features such as product variants, real-time price updates, and exportable configurations.
